Hello!

This is a demonstration of how different parameters change the image we see from a gravitational lens. This code is very largely taken from Adam S. Bolton's Strong Lensing Demo (@http://www.physics.utah.edu/~bolton/python_lens_demo/) and put in an interactive frame with sliders for the different parameter spaces. This provides an instaneous update to the image without the need for a command-line input. 

To run the demonstration, execute the file 'interactive_lens.py' with the file 'lensdemo_funcs.py' being in the same directory.
